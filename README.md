# RFM-analysis with K-Means and Hierarchial Clustering

RFM analysis is a data-driven marketing technique used by businesses to segment and analyze their customer base. It helps businesses understand and categorize customers based on their historical behavior and purchase patterns. The acronym “RFM” stands for:

1. Recency (R): This factor assesses how recently a customer has made a purchase or interacted with the business. Customers who have made a purchase more recently are considered more valuable because they are more likely to make future purchases. Recency is often measured in terms of the number of days, weeks, or months since the last transaction or interaction.
2. Frequency (F): Frequency measures how often a customer has made purchases or engaged with the business over a specific period. Customers who make frequent purchases are often more loyal and valuable to the business. Frequency can be calculated by counting the number of transactions or interactions within a given time frame.
3. Monetary Value (M): Monetary value or monetary contribution represents the total amount of money a customer has spent on the business’s products or services. Customers who have spent more money are typically considered more valuable. This can be measured as the sum of all the customer’s purchases or transactions.
